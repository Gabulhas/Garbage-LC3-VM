# LC3-VM in GO

This is my implementation of the Fictional/Learning Virtual Machine [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3](LC3-VM).
I coded this to learn more about Virtual Machines.

Work in Progress
- Some Instructions might be wrong :)


# TODO
- Refactor Code.
- Split Code into more files.
- Remove Debugging Code.
